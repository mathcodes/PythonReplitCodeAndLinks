# create a if statement that prints "You can ride the rollercoaster!" if height >= 120 

  # (think right to left here) Ask the user "What is your age? ", turn the value into an integer using 'int( )' and assign this to the newly declared variable 'age' 

  # use if statement to assign the value of 5 to the variable 'bill' IF age > 12. Also print "Child tickets are $5."

  # use elif statement to assign the value of 7 to the variable 'bill' IF age <= 18. Also print "Youth tickets are $7."
  
  # use elif statement to assign the value of 7 to the variable 'bill' IF age >= 40 and age <= 50. Also print "Everything is going to be ok. Have a free ride on us!"  

  # use else statement to assign the value of 12 to the variable 'bill', no condition needed as this is last statement taking care of all other situations, everything ELSE. Also print "Adult tickets are $12." 

  #Ask ""Do you want a photo taken? Y or N. "" and assign its value to 'wants_photo'

  # if the user wants a photo, we need to charge them an additional 2 dollars. Try to code this in python below using an 'if' statement

  # Use an 'f-statement' to print f"Your final bill is ${bill}"

# finish off the if-else statement with the 'else' statement to print "Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride."
